This project is to verify my knowledge of basic HTML, acquired from the odin web development course.

The website created on the course of this project has recipes for three easy-to-make dinners:
    - Sesame Grilled Salmon
    - Chicken Fiesta Salad
    - Amatriciana

The website has a basic structure, without the aid of CSS, and has an simple interface that is easy to navigate.
It demonstrates my knowledge of basic HTML tags and basic handling of git.
